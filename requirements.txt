## Requirements
This work was developed and tested with:
- Python 3.12.7
- TensorFlow 2.19.0
- Keras
- scikit-learn
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- tqdm
- joblib

## System Requirements
This implementation can run on standard desktop or laptop machines. However, for efficient feature extraction and model training, the following specifications are recommended:
- Processor (CPU): Quad-core Intel i5 / AMD Ryzen 5 or higher
- RAM: Minimum 8 GB (Recommended: 16 GB or more)
- GPU (Optional): NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (Recommended: 4 GB VRAM or higher, e.g., GTX 1650, RTX series)
- Disk Space: At least 5 GB free for datasets and outputs
- Operating System:Windows 10/11, Ubuntu 20.04+, or macOS 11+
> Note: GPU acceleration is optional but highly recommended for faster CNN feature extraction.
 Without GPU, the process may take longer.
